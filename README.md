## Title: 

Mobile application to guide users in applying cognitive behavioural therapy techniques.

## Abstract: 

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a popular and effective psychological treatment commonly used to treat patients with mental health issues like anxiety and depression. Preferably with the guidance of a professional, patients learn techniques to manage their symptoms and use worksheets to complete exercises. However, pen-and-paper worksheets can be inconvenient to use and patients may lose motivation, especially if they are unable to receive regular support from a professional. A mobile application has the potential to provide an accessible and engaging solution to this problem.

This report discusses current literature on CBT and existing case studies before detailing the design and development of a novel prototype mobile app to guide users through CBT exercises with the goal of increasing and maintaining user engagement. Test users found it highly usable and engaging, with notable advantages over traditional paper worksheets.
